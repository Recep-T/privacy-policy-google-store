This Privacy Policy describes how Recep Taylanhan ("we," "us," or "our") handles your information when you use the ISRA Prayer Times mobile application (the "App").

1. Information We Collect and Use
We are committed to collecting only the information strictly necessary for the App's function.

Data Type	Collection Status	Purpose of Collection
Precise Location (GPS Coordinates)	Collected	We require access to your device's precise location (GPS) to calculate accurate Islamic prayer times (Salat) and determine the correct Qibla direction.
User Identifiers (Device ID, Advertising ID)	Not Collected	We do not collect or track user identifiers, such as Apple's Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA).
Log Data (Crash Reports)	Collected (Anonymously)	We use standard platform tools (like Xcode/EAS's crash reports) to collect anonymous technical data about app crashes and errors to ensure stability. This data is non-identifiable.
2. Location Data Handling (Crucial)
Non-Storage: We DO NOT store, log, or track your precise location data on any external server or database.
Local Processing: Your location coordinates are processed only locally on your device and are used momentarily to calculate the prayer times displayed to you.
No Sharing: We DO NOT share or sell your location data with any third-party advertisers or data brokers.
3. Third-Party Services
The App does not use third-party analytics (like Google Analytics or Firebase Analytics) or advertising services. All core functionality is self-contained.

4. Children’s Privacy
Our App is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.
